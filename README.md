## Description
The project describes a game in which the player, after taking an **elevator ride**, arrives in a **mysterious new world** filled with **structures**, **lighting**, **objects**, and **diverse characters**.  

Each character has a **unique role** and **animations** â€“ some are **friendly** and provide **information** or **quests**, while others are **hostile** and challenge the player in **combat**.  

Interaction with these characters includes **conversations**, **assistance**, **item collection quests**, or **battles**, through which the player discovers how to return to the **original world**.  

At the **end of the adventure**, after completing the **main challenge**, the **path home** is finally revealed.
